# My Project Name Military Cadence
## Overview
This project will use python to ask the user the type of military cadence they want to read. After that it will randomly return a military cadence

## Inspiration
I chose to do this project to help soldiers learn cadences. Due to Covid19 soldiers have not run in formation for a long time and they have probably forgotten the words to some of the cadences.

## Skills Used
In order to accomplish this project, I had to use the following pythonic skills:
- from import
- functions
- if/elif/else logic
